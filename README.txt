Files Submitted
- Algo1.py - This is our algorithm that uses probability to find the best location to look
- Algo2.py - This is our algorithm that uses a reduced minimum constraint idea to find the best spot to dig
- Data folder - This contains all of our captured data that we used for our analysis pdf
- Varied Density Boards Folder - This folder contains all the density test cases given for us to use
- Varied Size Boards Folder - This folder contains all the size test cases given for us to use
- .gitignore - A basic gitignore file used for our version control
- README.txt - A text file containing an overview of the project
- algorithm.pdf - A pdf containing our analysis of Algo1 and Algo2
